# Object Detection yolo v5

This is a demo for the Yolo v5 with a custom dataset that is produced by Open Images Dataset v4.
The code will be found in the [colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1p-2TKwnnEnqigy9nL_9W-WwfUbf6jPWV?usp=sharing) and it is practical part of the paper of Object Detection overview.

This [colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1p-2TKwnnEnqigy9nL_9W-WwfUbf6jPWV?usp=sharing) notebook contains the creation of the custom dataset, the conversion from the OID labels to the yolov5 compatible and the training of the model with the different models.
